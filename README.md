### Statuses

What do the statuses mean?

* **Under consideration** - this is where ideas that are not fully formed started. Here they'll collect more feedback or wait until it can be worked on.

* **Planned** - these are ideas that will likely be implemented. The ideas are mostly baked so you can get a good idea of what's coming.

* **In progress** - an engineer is building the feature! Its likely that the feature will be pushed to Thingybase so that you can try it out and give feedback as its being built.

* **Done** - The feature was built and shipped. Give feedback on how it turned out.
